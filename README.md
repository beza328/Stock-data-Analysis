# Stock market data analysis

▎Overview

This project aims to analyze stock market movements of major tech companies (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, META) based on sentiment analysis of headline news data. By correlating news sentiment with stock price movements, the project seeks to uncover insights into how media coverage impacts market behavior.

▎Features

- Preprocess headline news data related to selected companies.
- Perform sentiment analysis on the news headlines using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Analyze historical stock price movements for AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, and META.
- Generate reports summarizing findings.

▎Technologies Used

- Python: The main programming language for analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- TextBlo: For sentiment analysis.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive coding environment.

▎Getting Started

▎Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas  textblob matplotlib seaborn


▎Dataset

The project requires two datasets:

1. Headline News Data: A CSV file containing headlines and stock market history data of AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, and META. Ensure the dataset contains at least the following columns:
   - Date
   - Headline
   -URL
   - publisher
   - stock-ticker
2. Stock Price Data: Historical stock market data for the selected companies in CSV format. Ensure it includes:
   - Date
   - Close
   - open
   - high
   - low
   - Adj Close

▎Steps to the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd stock-market-sentiment-analysis
   

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

      jupyter notebook
   

3. Open t.ipynb notebook.

4. Replace 'news_data.csv' and 'stock_data.csv' with the paths to your respective CSV files in the notebook code.

5. Run each cell sequentially to load the data, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize the results.

▎Example Usage

After loading your datasets, I perform sentiment analysis on the headlines as follows:

from textblob import TextBlob


    
# Apply sentiment analysis
news_data['Sentiment'] = news_data['Headline'].apply(get_sentiment)
